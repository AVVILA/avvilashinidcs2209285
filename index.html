         <h1>Advantage of Taking Online Courses</h1>
         <p>Online courses offer flexibility, affordable tuition, and a variety of academic opportunities.</p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="Advantages-col">
               <img src="images/online.jpg">
               <h3>More Comfortable Learning Environment</h3>
               <p>With the ability to study anywhere, online learners can complete coursework at home, a coffee shop, or a library.
                  This advantage of online learning allows students to work in the environment that best suits them.
               </p>

               <h3>Flexibility and Convenience</h3>
               <p>Perhaps the most obvious benefit of online learning is the flexibility and convenience it offers to students. You do not have to travel to campus to attend classes or take time off work to commit 
                  to a full-time course schedule. In a fully online program, you can continue to work your job while going to school.
               </p>

               <h3>Career Advancement</h3>
               <p>Nontraditional learners enjoy two significant advantages of online classes related to career advancement. First, a certificate or degree can qualify an employee for a raise.
                  Second, some companies restrict management-level positions to employees who possess a bachelor's or master's degree.
